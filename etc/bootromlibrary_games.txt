Games that use the Boot ROM library in some way:

Keio Yūgekitai
Jangō World Cup
Ishii Hisaichi no Daiseikai
Game no Kanzume games (sort of; they use the palette cache and possibly some other library-defined memory space, but doesn't seem to call any functions)

The following games all have a very similar code patterns when using the library, especially around vblank handling which is nearly identical to the vblank handler in the library itself:

Switch
Sing!! Sega Game Music Presented by B. B. Queens
Quiz Scramble Special (Japan) (Rev B)
WonderMega Collection
Aoki Ookami to Shiroki Mejika
Alshark
